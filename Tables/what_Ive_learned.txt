SUMMARY (10.05.2024)

- LaTeX offers the table and tabular environment for table creation
- The table environment acts like a wrapper for the tabular similar to the figure environment
- Alignment and vertical separators are passed as an argument to the tabular environment (e.g. \begin{tabular}{l|c||r})
- It’s possible to align the content left (l), centered (c) and right (r), where the number of alignment operators has to match the desired number of columns
- The columns can be seperated by adding | in between the alignment operators
- Rows can be seperated using the \hline command and columns using the ampersand & symbol
- The newline \\ operator indicates the end of a row
- It’s possible to refer to tables using \ref and \label
- Align numbers at the decimal point using the siunitx package
- Combine multiple rows and columns with the multirow package
- Prettify your tables using the booktabs package
- Make your tables span multiple pages with the longtable package
- Display your tables in landscape using the rotating package
